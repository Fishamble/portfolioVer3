<h2 align="center"> About </h2>
<p >
Hi and welcome to my portfolio. 
</p>
<p >
My name is John paul Larkin. I initially undertook web development as a hobby, soon realising I had a natural aptitude, and an inexhaustible curiosity for how it all worked. This developed into full time, self-directed study, employing the work ethic I developed during my years in the catering and healthcare industries. I thoroughly enjoy the technical challenge programming presents, developing new skills and implementing them in real world applications.
