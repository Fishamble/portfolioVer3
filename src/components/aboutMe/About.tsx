        <p>
          I rediscovered my passion for computers after undertaking web development as a hobby, soon realising I had a natural aptitude, and an inexhaustible curiosity for how it all
          worked. This developed into full time, self-directed study, employing the work ethic I developed during my years in the catering and
          healthcare industries. I thoroughly enjoy the technical challenge programming presents, developing new skills and implementing them in real
          world applications.
